The program performs the following:
1. Estimates DC motor parameters based on measurements of current, angular speed and output torque at no load, with (close to) rated load, and stall.
2. Computes and plots idealized characteristics that assume a constant internal friction torque.

The code is based on [this repository](https://github.com/DYK-Team/Brushed_DC_motor_solver/blob/master/main.py).

This Python console application (main.py) is designed for calculating the primary characteristics of brushed DC motors.
The generated report in the PDF file provides instructions on how to navigate through datasheets and extract parameters essential for modeling the motor.

Features:

  Data Extraction: Easily extract necessary parameters from motor datasheets.
  
  Calculation: Compute main characteristics based on parameters extracted from the motor datasheet.
  
  Educational and Practical: Suitable for both educational purposes and real-world applications.

Output files: Speed-to-torque_characteristics.csv, Torque-to-speed_characteristics.csv, Torque-to-power_characteristics.csv, Torque-to-efficiency_characteristics.csv

Output parameters: Maximum speed, Maximum torque, Maximum efficiency, Maximum mechanical power, No-load armature current, Torque-to-current coefficient, Voltage-to-speed coefficient (no load), dw/dT slope, Maximum angular acceleration (no load).
